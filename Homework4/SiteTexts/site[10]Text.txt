 Software Development Conference, Oct 24-28 
 I have loved QCon and I've learned so much about what is hot in the industry, what's coming up next and what are people thinking/care about? Every time I go to QCon I learn about new things that I want to take back to my team. Whether they're new technologies, new ways of working or new processes and so on.

 I've tired this on my Mac and it seems to be fine.  Are you stuck behind a firewall maybe?  Otherwise let me know what version of OS X you are running and the browser you are using and I'll see if I can re-produce the problem. Thanks, Charles
